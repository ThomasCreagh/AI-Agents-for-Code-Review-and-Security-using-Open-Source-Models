          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>
            We are a team of passionate 2nd and 3rd-year Computer Science
            students at Trinity College, collaborating with IBM to develop an
            AI-powered code review system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to automate code quality assessments and security
            testing, making software development faster, safer, and more
            efficient. As a startup project, we are still in the early stages,
            actively refining our system to ensure it meets industry standards.
